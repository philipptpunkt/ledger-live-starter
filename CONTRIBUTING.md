# Contributing to Ledger Live Starter

Thank you for contributing to ledger-live-starter! This guide will help you understand our development workflow and release process.

## üöÄ Release Process

We use [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases and changelog generation. This means:

- **No manual version bumps** - versions are automatically determined from commit messages
- **Automatic changelog generation** - based on your commit messages
- **Automatic releases** - when release PRs are merged

## üìù Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Your commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **`feat:`** - A new feature (triggers **minor** version bump)
- **`fix:`** - A bug fix (triggers **patch** version bump)
- **`docs:`** - Documentation only changes
- **`style:`** - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **`refactor:`** - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **`perf:`** - A code change that improves performance
- **`test:`** - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **`build:`** - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **`ci:`** - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **`chore:`** - Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **`revert:`** - Reverts a previous commit

### Breaking Changes

To trigger a **major** version bump, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer or add `!` after the type:

```bash
feat!: redesign CLI interface
# or
feat: new command structure

BREAKING CHANGE: CLI commands have been restructured
```

### Examples

```bash

# Major version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
feat!: redesign CLI interface
feat: change command structure

BREAKING CHANGE: All CLI commands have been restructured for better usability
```

git commit -m "docs: update README with feature info"
```

### 2. Pull Request
